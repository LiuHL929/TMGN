## Dataset

This project uses the **Remote Sensing VQA - Low Resolution (RSVQA-LR)** and **High Resolution (RSVQA-HR)** datasets, created by Sylvain Lobry, Diego Marcos, Jesse Murray, and Devis Tuia.

* **Homepage:** More information about the dataset can be found on the official website(https://rsvqa.sylvainlobry.com/).
* **Download Links:** The dataset is available in two resolutions:
    * [Low Resolution](https://zenodo.org/api/records/6344334/files-archive)
    * [High Resolution](https://zenodo.org/api/records/6344367/files-archive)
