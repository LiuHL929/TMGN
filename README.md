This project uses the **Remote Sensing VQA - Low Resolution (RSVQA-LR)** and **High Resolution (RSVQA-HR)** datasets, created by Sylvain Lobry, Diego Marcos, Jesse Murray, and Devis Tuia.

* **Homepage:** More information about the dataset can be found on the official website(https://rsvqa.sylvainlobry.com/).
* **Download Links:** The dataset is available in two resolutions:
    * [Low Resolution](https://zenodo.org/api/records/6344334/files-archive)

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Sylvain Lobry, Diego Marcos, Jesse Murray, and Devis Tuia for creating and publicly sharing the valuable RSVQA dataset. This project would not have been possible without their significant contribution to the remote sensing research community.
